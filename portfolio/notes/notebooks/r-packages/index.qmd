## Workflow

### `renv`

Helpful for creating reproducible environments - creates a lock file in JSON format that lists dependencies and versions. This lock file acts as a pointer to where the dependencies are stored on your machine, so you don't have to install them every time you start a new project.

```r
# initalize renv
renv::init()

# update renv.lock
renv::snapshot()

# restore the project to the state saved in renv.lock
renv::restore()
```

```{.json filename="renv.lock"}
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.2.2",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
    "dplyr": {
      "Package": "dplyr",
      "Version": "1.1.4",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Requirements": [
        "R",
        "R6",
        "cli",
        "generics",
        "glue",
        ...
```

### `here`

Useful when working with file paths in R - creates paths relative to top-level directory.

```r
path <- here::here("path", "to", "file", "name.csv")

path <- "/path/to/file/name.csv"
```

## ggplot2 Extensions

See [extension site](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for more.

## Visualization

### `magick`

For image processing in R.

Appending images:

```r
library(magick)

image_1 <- image_read("image1.png")
image_2 <- image_read("image2.png")

appended_images <- image_append(c(image_1, image_2), stack = TRUE)

image_write(appended_images, "appended_images.png")
```
